I feel this information could be useful for people looking for a language.
Should rename the project.

## Goals

I've heard good and bad things about many languages before, people often pick favourites and get very defensive about them.
Sometimes it feels like the *quality* of a language is determined by how old it is, rather than how good it is.

To get to the bottom of this, I've deciced to remake the same project in over 20 different languages.

The project I've chosen is a countdown timer. This feels like a good choice since it requires:

- Getting the users input from `stdin`
- Accessing the OS's sleep function
- Formatting the time left with zero padding, for example: `01:08`
- Using a floor function from the languages math library

Here's some pseudo code of the timer:

```
time = 60

while time != 0 
    mins = floor(t / 60)
    secs = t % 60

    print mins secs
    sleep 1 second
    t--
```

### Rankings

There are some import things to note when looking for a new language.
The best language is one that is easiest to learn.
Many new `simple` languages lack documentation and are not a good choice for people learning.

Tooling is often very important, having a nice build tool like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) can make life easy.

Libraries are a very important part of any language eco-system. 
Most of us don't have time to reinvent the wheel every day. 
Sometimes languages are worth using for a simple package.
Many people use Python just for TensorFlow or PyTorch.

--- 

#### Something I like about each language:

Python: Very clean input function. Only language that has a `divmod` function. Standard library seems very strong and comprehensive.

JavaScript: Despite being built for the web. It's was still very easy to setup dependencies and find documentation.

TypeScript: TODO

C: `printf` is very easy to use. No hassles with flushing `stdout`.

C++: I've used this language a lot before I swapped to rust. I swapped for a reason.

Go: Automatically imports every that you need. I wish rust had this! 

Rust: I don't think rust's benefits matter for a project this small.
However the `cargo` is the best build tool I've ever used. 
Plus the documentation for this language is unmatched. 

V: It's simple to write, fast to compile.
This language is what Go should have been.

Nim: Very simple to write, feels like a cross between rust and python.

Zig: This language is awful

Odin: This language is also awful

Java: This language is awful

Kotlin: Much better than Java, I think I'd enjoy writing android apps with this language.

Lua: This was the only language on the list which made me angry.

C#: It's better than Java.

Elixir: The only functional language that actually worked for me. Opened my mind to new ways of thinking about programming.

Haskell: TODO

Elm: TODO

ReasonML: TODO

OCaml: -

Gleam: This language want's to make functional programing accessible, however it's very new. I'll keep an eye on this one.

Clojure: -

## Interpreted

### Python

- Documentation: 

  https://docs.python.org/3/

- Required Computer Knowledge: 

  Low

- Install Guide:

  https://www.python.org/ > 
  https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/ >
  https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download >
  https://www.python.org/downloads/ 

  Adding to path requires ticking a checkbox

  Cannot be installed by following instructions;.

- Build Command:

  `python timer.py`

Python is simple as long as you don't require any dependencies.
I find the syntax to be difficult at scale but fine for small projects.
I would also caution people in using interpreted languages as they are inherently slow.

### JavaScript

Keep in mind that I'm talking about JavaScript + Node.js.

- Documentation: 

  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript

  https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v15.x/api/

  https://nodejs.dev/learn/introduction-to-nodejs

  >I really like node's introduction to nodejs.

- Required Computer Knowledge:

  Moderate

- Install Guide:
  First you need to understand that JavaScript is dynamic and requires a `runtime` like Node.js or Deno.

  https://nodejs.org/en/

  Installing is really easy, doesn't require modifying your path. 

- Build Command: 

  `node timer.js`


It may be hard for people to understand that JavaScript requires a runtime like NodeJs. I can't recommend this language to new users because of this.

Node's `read-line` class is not easy to use. 
I used `prompt-sync` instead as it was easy to setup and use.

I'm not a fan of the async code required, it's clear that JavaScript was build for the web.
Please use it in that context.


### TypeScript

Install typescript `npm install -g typescript`

Create a project with `npm i -D typescript`

Run with `node timer.ts`

NodeJs is super annoying with it's imports.

## Compiled

### C

- Documentation: 

  There is no official documentation

- Required Computer Knowledge:

  High

- Build Command:

  `gcc timer.c -o timer.exe;timer.exe`

- Install Guide:

  C has no official guide.

Fairly simple to write. 
At first I didn't like `scanf`, but it turned out to be better than 90% of languages I tried.
Unfortunately C lacks an easy cross-platform sleep function.
Sometimes C would compile even though my IDE was telling me there should be an error.
It feels very difficult to find bugs in C code.

An annoying habit seems to start here with C. 
I would like to build and run my program in one command, for example: `gcc timer.c --run`.
Instead I will build and run with the following: `gcc timer.c -o timer.exe;timer.exe`.
See the issue? If my program fails to compile I will still run the program. 

I have looked for a solution but with no success.

My project is so simple that it does not highlight any of C's issues. It feels unfair to talk about them without examples. 
All I'll say is, C has not changed for a long time, there are *new* and *different* approaches to solving programming problems.
Give them a go and you might be surprised.

### C++

- Documentation: 

  https://en.cppreference.com/w/

- Required Computer Knowledge:

  High

- Build Command:

  `g++ timer.cpp -o timer.exe; ./timer`

- Install Guide:

  https://isocpp.org/get-started 

This is somehow worse than C. I think I understand why people don't like this language now.

This print function is not good. Maybe I'm using it wrong?

```cpp
  std::cout << std::setfill('0') << std::setw(2) << mins;
  std::cout << ":";
  std::cout << std::setfill('0') << std::setw(2) << secs;
```


### V 

- Documentation: 

  https://github.com/vlang/v/blob/master/doc/docs.md

  https://modules.vlang.io/

- Required Computer Knowledge:

  High

- Build Command:

  `v run .`

- Install Guide:

  V has no official guide.

V is quite a new language and has some rough edges

- Documentation is lacking
- Language server is in alpha 
- Lack of resources/learning material

Despite this I really like writing code with V. 
The code is simple, the compiler is fast and has great messages. 
Standard library documentation is very easy to navigate.

I have high hopes for this language.

An example error message:

```v
.\timer.v:11:13: error: string types only have the following operators defined: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, and `+`
    9 |     for t != 0 {
   10 |         mins := math.floor(t / 60)
   11 |         secs := t % 60
      |                   ^
   12 |         print('${mins:02}:${secs:02}\r')
   13 |         time.sleep(1 * time.second)
.\timer.v:14:3: error: operator `-=` not defined on left operand type `string`
   12 |         print('${mins:02}:${secs:02}\r')
   13 |         time.sleep(1 * time.second)
   14 |         t -= 1
      |         ^
   15 |     }
   16 | }
```

### Rust

- Documentation: 

  https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/

  https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/

- Required Computer Knowledge:

  High

- Build Command:

  `cargo run`

- Install Guide:

  https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started

First off, Rust is missing an input function like most other languages. 
Here is how to get the users input: 

```rust
use std::io::{stdin, stdout, Write};

let mut s = String::new();
print!("Please enter some text: ");
stdout().flush().unwrap();
stdin().read_line(&mut s).unwrap();

// remove \r\n
s.pop();
s.pop();

let i = s.parse::<i32>().unwrap();
println!("You entered the number: {}", i);
```

Not great. However there is discussion and an active pull request to fix the issue.

https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3196
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75435

I really want to show off how simple rust can be, so I created a crate to get user input.
I created the crate [read_io](https://crates.io/crates/read_io). 

Here is the new input code:

```rust
let mut t: i32 = read!("Enter the time in seconds: ");
```

Hopefully something like this can be added to the standard library one day.

Rust has some of the best documentation out of any language and `cargo` is a really nice build tool. 

### Zig
- Documentation: 

  https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/
  https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/

- Required Computer Knowledge:

  High

- Build Command:

  `zig build run`

- Install Guide:

  https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/


Compile times are bad, error messages are bad, documentation is bad. 
This language feels like it was written by someone who wanted to make C even harder to use.

```log
C:\path\zig\lib\std\fmt.zig:82:9: error: Expected tuple or struct argument, found std.fmt.ParseIntError!i64
        @compileError("Expected tuple or struct argument, found " ++ @typeName(ArgsType));
        ^

            return std.fmt.format(self, format, args);
                                 ^
```

### Go

- Documentation: 

  https://pkg.go.dev/std

- Required Computer Knowledge:

  Moderate 

- Build Command:

  `go run .`

- Install Guide:

  https://go.dev/doc/install

This language is somehow more complicated than rust.
The functions are super weird, `ReadString` reads up to a certain character and includes it. So your always going to have `\r\n` in your input.
Worse than that, there's no pop function. Not epic.
I can't believe how bad the documentation is and how shit the api is.
I see why V exists now, yikes...
I do like the way it auto imports modules I would like that for rust since it's such an import heavy language.

```go
# timer
.\timer.go:21:24: cannot use t / 60 (type int) as type float64 in argument to math.Floor
```

### Nim

- Documentation: 
  https://nim-lang.org/docs/lib.html
  https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html

- Required Computer Knowledge:

  Moderate 

- Build Command:

  `nim c -r timer.nim`

- Install Guide:

  https://nim-lang.org/install_windows.html


Installing is simple. 
Documentation is decent and the language is quite simple.
It's like a complied version of python. 
Compile times are quite slow which is unfortunate since it might be a good choice otherwise.

### Odin

- Documentation: 

  https://pkg.odin-lang.org/core/

- Required Computer Knowledge:

  High 

- Build Command:

  `odin run .`

- Install Guide:

  https://odin-lang.org/docs/install/
  This guide is bad and does not provide enough instructions.

Documentation does not have a functional search and the source code is hard to read. 
Even with LSP I cannot find a way to convert a string to an int.

## Bytecode

### Lua

- Documentation: 

  https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/

- Required Computer Knowledge:

  High 

- Build Command:

  `lua timer.lua`

- Install Guide:

  There is no install guide


I wanted to use luasocket for my sleep function, since Lua does not have one included.
After running `luarocks install luasocket` I recieve this nice error:

```lua
Installing https://luarocks.org/luasocket-3.0rc1-2.src.rock

luasocket 3.0rc1-2 depends on lua >= 5.1 (5.4-1 provided by VM)

Error: Build error: Failed compiling object src/luasocket.o
```

After fixing that I recieve a new error:

```
Installing https://luarocks.org/luasocket-3.0rc1-2.src.rock

Error: Failed finding Lua header files. You may need to install them or configure LUA_INCDIR.
```

I decied to use something I found on stack overflow instead:

```lua
function sleep(n)
  if n > 0 then os.execute("ping -n " .. tonumber(n+1) .. " localhost > NUL") end
end
```

The documentation is horrible, the syntax is somehow worse the python.
This language took me the longest to write, don't use it.

### Java

This language is like 100 years old but there still isn't any good documentation for it.

Building is pretty standard `javac timer.java;java Timer`

Errors are pretty decent: 

```log
timer.java:8: error: incompatible types: int cannot be converted to boolean
    while (t) {
           ^
timer.java:9: error: incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from double to int
        int mins = Math.floor(t / 60);
                             ^
2 errors
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NumberFormatException: Cannot parse null string
```

Java is old, overcomplicated and not very useful. The benefits of byte code languages don't seem to be worth it nowadays.
Especially given V's sub second compile times.

I've used maven a few times and it seems okay.

### C#

Getting setup with this language is extremely difficult. I don't know what I need, visual studio, .NET SDK?
After downloading something, it seems to work?

Creating a new project with `dotnet new console --framework net6.0`

Running with `dotnet run`

Error messages:

```log
Unhandled exception. System.FormatException: Format specifier was invalid.
   at System.Number.GetFloatingPointMaxDigitsAndPrecision(Char fmt, Int32& precision, NumberFormatInfo info, Boolean& isSignificantDigits)
   at System.Number.FormatDouble(ValueStringBuilder& sb, Double value, ReadOnlySpan`1 format, NumberFormatInfo info)

   at System.String.Format(String format, Object arg0, Object arg1)
   at Program.<Main>$(String[] args) in D:\Git\Project-Omnia\Bytecode\C#\Program.cs:line 9
```

Definitely better than Java however it's still a bit rough around the edges.
Documentation is okay.
Build tools are okay.

### Kotlin

Kotlin seems to be focus towards IDE use. However there is an article about using it in the command line.

https://kotlinlang.org/docs/command-line.html

I don't know if it's suppose to take so long to compile but it's basically unusable.

I measured `5.01` seconds to compile and run hello world.

```
kotlinc timer.kt -include-runtime -d timer.jar
java -jar timer.jar
```

Don't see the point of even trying to use this language but i'll give it a go.

An error message:

```log
  timer.kt:9:22: error: overload resolution ambiguity: 
  public final operator fun rem(other: Byte): Double defined in kotlin.Double
  public final operator fun rem(other: Byte): Int defined in kotlin.Int
  public final operator fun rem(other: Int): Double defined in kotlin.Double
  public final operator fun rem(other: Int): Int defined in kotlin.Int
  public final operator fun rem(other: Long): Double defined in kotlin.Double
  public final operator fun rem(other: Long): Long defined in kotlin.Int
  public final operator fun rem(other: Short): Double defined in kotlin.Double
  public final operator fun rem(other: Short): Int defined in kotlin.Int
  var secs = t.rem(60);
```

I got so many of these overload ambiguity errors it's insane.

The syntax is okay, much simpler than java. 

Documentation is okay. 

Error messages and compile times are awful.

If this language didn't give me so much hassle with types, i would've given it a *good* in simplicity.

## Functional

### Elm

This language is built for making websites?

TODO this can't be right

### ReasonML

They have some instructions on setup. 

```log
git clone https://github.com/esy-ocaml/hello-reason.git
cd hello-reason

# Install all dependencies (might take a while in the first run)
esy 

# Compile and run Hello.exe
esy x Hello
```

It then install 10,000 packages and spits out this error: 

```log

🤨

TODO ...

### Gleam

Required me to put gleam.exe in path. It's nice that it's just a single exe though.
Then I needed to install erlang and put it into path.

Trying to get the user input was not easy.

*The `io.get_list` function has been moved to the `gleam_os` library.*

Where is this gleam_os library? This library does not seem to have much documentation?

`gleam add gleam_erlang`

No sleep function. How to write a while loop? Where are the if statements?

### Elixir

Check out these errors I got:

```log

    (elixir 1.13.3) lib/kernel.ex:6111: Kernel.assert_module_scope/3
    (elixir 1.13.3) lib/kernel.ex:4839: Kernel.define/4

Oof. I'm still impressed with some of the things I've seen. I don't think *Elixir* is it yet.

### Haskell

- Documentation: 

  There is no offical documentation.

- Required Computer Knowledge:

  Extreme 

- Build Command:

  `ghc timer.hs;./timer.exe`

- Install Guide:

  https://www.haskell.org/downloads/

Starting off with some extremely confusing install instructions:

```
This page describes the installation of the Haskell toolchain, which consists of the following tools:

GHC: the Glasgow Haskell Compiler

cabal-install: the Cabal installation tool for managing Haskell software

stack: a cross-platform program for developing Haskell projects

haskell-language-server (optional): A language server for developers to integrate with their editor/IDE

Installation instructions
for Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, Windows or WSL2

Install GHC, cabal-install and haskell-language-server via GHCup
To install stack, follow the instructions here (N.B. stack does not support FreeBSD)
```

This isn't even english. I think i'm supposed to go here: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_9_2_1.html#windows64

I just used `scoop install haskell stack` instead. It's 500mb's... oof.

To setup the project:

```
stack new timer
cd timer
stack run
```

Then download another 400MB for the compile which is already installed.

Then downloading it downloaded msys2??

I guess we're installing linux now.

I opted for a simpler approach `ghc timer.hs;./timer.exe`

Compile times are exceptionally bad for this language.
3742 ms to compile hello world.

The documentation is worse than Elixir plus the language is harder to understand.

This compile message is formatted nicely but impossable to understand.

```haskell
timer.hs:8:3: error:
    • Couldn't match expected type ‘IO a0’ with actual type ‘Integer’
    • In a stmt of a 'do' block: countdown (t)
      In the expression:
        do putStr "Enter a time in seconds:"
           s <- getLine
           let t = ...
           countdown (t)
           ....
      In an equation for ‘main’:
          main
            = do putStr "Enter a time in seconds:"
                 s <- getLine
                 let t = ...
                 ....
  |
8 |   countdown (t)
  |   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

This language is cursed.

### Clojure 

> Currently, clj on Windows is in an alpha state. Please try it and provide feedback in the TDEPS jira or on #clj-on-windows room on Clojurians slack.

### Erlang

https://www.erlang.org/doc/getting_started/intro.html

The documentation for this language is so out of date. I can't even find what the file extension is.
